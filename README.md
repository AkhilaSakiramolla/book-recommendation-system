# Goodreads Book Recommendation System 

A recommender system is a machine learning system that helps users discover new products 
and services. It guides you every time you shop online towards the most likely product you should 
purchase. My aim for this project is to analyze the book's information to understand the 
userâ€™s reading habits and to understand what factors lead to the increasing popularity of certain 
books. I implemented a recommendation system which will help users get a list of 
recommendations based on their previous reads.

In order to develop a recommendation system, I have primarily worked on Google Cloud 
Platform, as a cloud platform is very instrumental in building efficient and scalable applications. 
To account for increasing amount of data, I have built this recommendation system in PySpark as 
it is a distributed computing framework and does efficient real-time, large scale data processing 
by leveraging parallel computing. To use Python with PySpark framework, I made use of the API 
calls to Spark. For increased speed on data processing, it is capable of both memory and disk 
computations. By running on top of Hadoop distributed file systems, it can process structured data.
